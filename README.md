# Calculator
Simple JS calculator: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Can make simple operations on two inputs and display it on "screen". <br>
  <li>Hitting "=" button repeats operation over last result.<br>
</ul>

Issues:
<ul>
  <li>Not entering second operand and hitting "=" button will result in NaN.<br>
  <li>No limit to how many numbers can fit onto "screen". Inputs and Outputs bleed out of "screen".<br>
  <li>With 130+ lines of code, probably could use some optimisation.<br>
</ul>

Reason for existance:
<ul>
  <li>Practicing JS algorithm and DOM manipulation :)
</ul>
